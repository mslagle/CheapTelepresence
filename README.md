# CheapTelepresence

The cheap telepresence robot aims to create a telepresence robot for less than $100 not including a tablet.  This project utilizes cheap aluminum square tubing instead of expensive extruded aluminum and 3d printed parts for the connectors.  An arduino and a cheap brushed motor controller keep costs down.
